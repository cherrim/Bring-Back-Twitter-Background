How to use:
-   open the raw .user.js file with greasemonkey (or whatever userscript parser extension you use)
    and it should prompt you to install it. Raw: https://github.com/cherrim/twitter-bg/raw/master/twitter-bg.user.js
-   when you do, make sure you follow the instructions and edit line 26 to customize your background
-   hex code doesn't really matter if you're replacing the background. you can leave it black/#000000
-   remember that your bg image MUST be hosted on twitter. 
      (ex: https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_background_images/378800000114244658/f2ec24c0f401f2bc238c5ee400efe2a5.png)
      * When I tested it, it worked just fine using someone else's photo so you can upload an image
        with a tweet and direct link to that and it should work fine

Remember this only works for you. No one else will see your background. 

Note: thanks to the super simple tutorial for just about the entire code lmao:
